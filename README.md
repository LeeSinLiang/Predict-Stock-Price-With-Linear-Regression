# Predict-Stock-Price-With-Linear-Regression

#### This is a Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning and Linear Regression Model. You can choose whatever CSV Stock File to predict as long they have rows of CLOSE. I recommend downloading historical stock price data at [Yahoo Finance](finance.yahoo.com). 

## Choosing Data Set Wisely

> ***Why do I need a data set?***  
ML depends heavily on data, without data, it is impossible for an “AI” to learn. It is the most crucial aspect that makes algorithm training possible… No matter how great your AI team is or the size of your data set, if your data set is not good enough, your entire AI project will fail! I have seen fantastic projects fail because we didn’t have a good data set despite having the perfect use case and very skilled data scientists.

####  In conclusion, we must pick dataset that is good for our Linear Regression Model. In this case, we must not use dataset that contains stock prices from the starting point of the company IPO to the current stock price.
